## Problem

### Balance the Towers

You are given $N$ towers with heights $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$ and an integer $K$.

For each tower, you must perform  **exactly one**  of the following operations:

- increase its height by $K$, or
- decrease its height by $K$.

A tower cannot have a negative height after the operation.

After modifying all $N$ towers, let the tallest tower have height $H_{\max}$ and the shortest tower have height $H_{\min}$.

Find the  **minimum possible value of $H_{\max}-H_{\min}$**.

### Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ — the number of towers and the amount by which each tower must be increased or decreased.

The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N$ — the initial heights of the towers.

### Output Format

Print a single integer — the minimum possible difference between the tallest and shortest tower after all towers are modified.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le K \le 10^7$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4 2
1 5 8 10
```

```
5
```

### Explanation:

One optimal modification is:

`1 5 8 10` $\rightarrow$ `3 3 6 8`

The tallest tower has height $8$ and the shortest has height $3$.

Therefore, the minimum possible difference is $8-3=5$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
5 3
3 9 12 16 20
```

```
11
```

### Explanation:

One optimal modification is:

`3 9 12 16 20` $\rightarrow$ `6 6 9 13 17`

The difference between the tallest and shortest towers is $17-6=11$.

Therefore, the minimum possible difference is `11`.
