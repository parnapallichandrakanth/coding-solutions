## Problem

### Triangles

It is well known fact in mathematics that the sum of the $3$ angles in a triangle is $180$ degrees.

You had a triangle, but unfortunately you only remember the $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ angles of it, and you have forgotten the $3^{rd}$ one.

Given that the first angle was $A$, and the second was $B$, can you figure out the third one? All angles are integers measured in degrees.

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input contains $2$ integers - $A$ and $B$.
### Output Format

Print a single integer - the measure of the $3^{rd}$ angle (in degrees).

### Constraints
- $1 \le A, B \lt 180$
- $A + B \lt 180$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
60 60

```

```
60

```

### Explanation:

It is an equilateral triangle, and has all angles equal.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
1 1

```

```
178

```
